📌 WasteNot — Project Overview

WasteNot is a full-stack web and mobile application project aimed at reducing food waste by connecting surplus food with those who need it. The system includes both frontend and backend components — built to enable users to easily interact with the application, manage data, and perform core actions related to food sharing and sustainability.

🌟 Key Features

Although the repository itself does not currently include a published description, based on its folder structure and comparable WasteNot apps, the project likely includes:

🔹 User-Centered Functionality

User registration & authentication — sign up, log in, and manage profiles.

Food listing & management — users can add food items they want to give away or track.

Search & discovery — find available items shared by other users.

Real-time interaction — chat or communication between donors and receivers (possible).

Responsive UI — accessible via web and/or mobile interfaces.

🔹 Full-Stack Structure

The project is divided into separate parts, indicating a modern architecture:

✔ Frontend

A user-facing UI likely built using React or another JavaScript framework — handles navigation, form input, and presentation.

✔ Backend

Server logic exposing APIs, handling authentication, database operations, and business logic — likely built with Node.js/Express or a similar backend framework.

✔ UI / Assets

A dedicated folder for design, static assets, or additional interface resources — useful for UX/UI consistency.

🛠 Technology Stack (Inferred)

Based on the languages shown in the repo:

JavaScript — primary programming language.

HTML & CSS — structure and styling for frontend views.

Node/Express or similar — for backend API services.

Frontend frameworks (React/Vanilla) — for UI components.

(Optional additions can include database support such as MongoDB/PostgreSQL, depending on implementation.)

🎯 Project Goals

WasteNot aims to:

⭐ Reduce food waste by making it easy to share or donate extra food.

🌍 Support community needs, especially individuals and organizations looking for food.

💡 Encourage eco-friendly behavior through a simple user experience.

📦 Serve as a scalable platform that can be expanded with features like notifications, mapping, AI-assisted suggestions, or integration with food banks.
